# Learning Progressive Web Apps: Companion Source Code

> I recently deleted the email addresses associated with this book. If you need to reach me, do so through [Issues](https://github.com/johnwargo/learning-pwa-code/issues).


This repository contains the source code to accompany [Learning Progressive Web Apps (PWA)](https://learningpwa.com).

**Note:** In October, 2020, Microsoft made changes to the Bing Search API used in the book's sample code for Chapters 3 through 5.  Because of that change, some readers (anyone who started working with the book's code after Microsoft's announcement) must use different code for those chapters. Since the change affects some readers differently, I had to leave the original code in place and provide alternate code in the repository's `updated-server` folder for the readers that need it.  Take a look at that folder's [`readme.md`](https://github.com/johnwargo/learning-pwa-code/tree/master/updated-server) file for additional instructions.
